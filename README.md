# PNJU
auto login to the school network  
Some really innocent code for a junior student, a little shame but it's written with the purpose of learning scrapy. That's it.

If you want to use it:
1. download the source code to your computer
2. edit the pnju.bat -> change the path to where you download this simple project
3. new file in the inner PNJU, naming config.py, where you put username and password in.  
 eg:  
  username = '151250093'  
  password = '569797813'
