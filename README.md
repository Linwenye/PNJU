## Introduction

Some really innocent code for a junior student, a little shame but it's written with the purpose of learning scrapy. That's it.

## If you want to use it
This project is just for testing the Scrapy FormRequest method, and it's slower than using requests actually.

So just jump to another project called PNJU2.
